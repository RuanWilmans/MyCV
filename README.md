# Task 15-004 — Deployment of Static Websites (Final Submission)

This folder contains everything required for the two practicals:

## Practical Task 1 — Deploy a previous static page to GitHub Pages
1) Create a **public** repo in GitHub and upload your static page (ensure the entry file is `index.html`).  
2) In **Settings → Pages**, set **Branch = main** and **/root**. Wait for the "Site is published" banner.  
3) Visit `https://username.github.io/repoName` and take a screenshot with the URL visible.  
4) Put your final URL in **static_url.txt** and replace **static_page.png** with your real screenshot.

## Practical Task 2 — Create & deploy personal CV webpage
1) Create a **public** repo called **MyCV** and upload the contents of this folder.  
2) In **Settings → Pages**, set **Branch = main** and **/root**.  
3) Replace `assets/headshot.png` with your real photo (same filename).  
4) Take a screenshot of the live site showing the URL and replace **my_cv.png**.  
5) Put your final URL in **my_cv.txt**.

> Tip: If the site doesn't load, ensure the entry file is **index.html** and the repo is **Public**.
